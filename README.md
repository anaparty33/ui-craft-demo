While rendering, this app by default takes the Los Angeles City and displays weather information for it.

I recommend playing around using the search input field  (which is powered by Google Autocomplete for places ), navigation logo, and units option to the top right 

# Features
- User can search for  any city, or place or use a postal code to search for important weather information
- User can check the current location weather by clicking the navigate icon
- Can toggle units  Celsius and Fahrenheit.  Unit conversion is done by local utilities which can save another call to OpenWeaher API


# Improvements
- still need to add  more responsive styling to more different layouts like iPad, and mobile. Add tailwind variables in my index.css to avoid repeating styles
- Adding a mock server to fetch data / making some mock data and using it in test cases.
- Could add more strict types as it contains some type warnings, I kind of skipped these in `vite build`
